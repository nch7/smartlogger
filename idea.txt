Name: SmartLogger
Description: Service for collecting and analyzing the logs, helps companies prioritize bugs they need to fix.



Core of the idea:

### Everytime error occurs in an application, the company loses money.
### Companies need to know which errors make them lose the most money.

# Programmer defines the type of logs that will be sent to SmartLogger. 
# The single log which is sent to SmartLogger has following attributes:
    a. MS (Monetary Score) - value that company potentially loses because of given error. !!! This is the gem of our service !!!
    b. Description - Error description.
    c. Meta - Additional key-value structure which can be used for storing more details about the error. 




Service:

# SmartLogger dashboard will have a list of all the logs collected so far from the given project.
# SmartLogger keeps track of TMS (Total MS - Sum of MS's) for each type of error. 
# SmartLogger uses TMS to suggest the prioritized list of bugs that a company needs to fix.




Business:
# There are multiple subscription plans which vary by the limit of logs that can be sent/stored/analyzed.




Maybe?

# SmartLogger automatically re-arranges the tasks in Asana/Trello/etc based on their TMS.
